2.21

This release includes the following new features:

- Adds support for the Client-Side Operations Timeout (CSOT) feature, which unifies
  most timeout-related options under a single ``timeout_ms`` option.
- Adds support for MongoDB Server version 8.0.
- Adds support for range v2 queries with Queryable Encryption, including a new ``trim_factor``
  parameter. For more information about Queryable Encryption, see :manual:`Queryable Encryption </core/queryable-encryption>`
  in the MongoDB Server manual.

.. _release-notes-2.20:

2.20
====

This release includes the following new features:

- Support for Ruby 2.5 and 2.6 has been discontinued. Support for Ruby 2.7 and
  JRuby 9.2 has been deprecated, and will be discontinued in the next minor
  driver version. Support for JRuby 9.4 has been added.
- Support for the newly-released Ruby-BSON version 5.0.
- Connection strings no longer require a slash between the hosts and the
  options. E.g., "mongodb://example.com?w=1" and "mongodb://example.com/?w=1"
  are both valid connection strings now.
- Container runtime and orchestration metadata for the client environment are
  now sent to the server for analytics purposes.
- A warning message is now written to the log when the host is detected to be
  a CosmosDB (Azure) or DocumentDB (Amazon) instance.
- When attempting a retry of a read or write operation in a sharded topology,
  the retry will be attempted on a different mongos instance, if possible.
