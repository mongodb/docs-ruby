   .. step:: Install dependencies

      Before you being developing, ensure you have the following dependencies
      installed in your development environment:
      
      - `Ruby <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/>`__ version 2.7
        or later
      - `bson <https://rubygems.org/gems/bson>`__ versions 4.14.1 to 6.0

      .. note::

         {+language+} is pre-installed on macOS and some Linux distributions,
         but the system version might be outdated. You can use a package 
         manager, such as `Homebrew <https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ruby>`__,
         to install the latest {+language+} version.

   .. step:: Install the {+driver-short+}

      From your shell, run the following command to install
      the {+driver-short+}:

      .. code-block:: bash
         
         gem install mongo

      This command installs version {+version-number+} of
      the driver.

   .. step:: Create a project directory

      Run the following command in your shell to create a directory
      called ``ruby-quickstart`` for this project:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mkdir ruby-quickstart

      Select the tab corresponding to your operating system and run the following commands
      to create a ``quickstart.rb`` file in the ``ruby-quickstart`` directory:

      .. tabs::

          .. tab:: macOS / Linux
             :tabid: create-file-mac-linux

             .. code-block:: bash

                cd ruby-quickstart
                touch quickstart.rb

          .. tab:: Windows
             :tabid: create-file-windows

             .. code-block:: bash

                cd ruby-quickstart
                type nul > quickstart.rb

After you complete these steps, you have a new project directory with the driver
dependencies installed.
